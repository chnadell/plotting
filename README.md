data plotting techniques
A collection of plotting techniques using in the study of machine learning and metamaterials.
1. Crossval is a plotting code from some of my work with deep learning for metamaterials. 
2. adaptive is an exploration of the capabilities of the [adaptive module](https://github.com/python-adaptive/adaptive) for python. Really cool stuff capable of plotting functions that are expensive to compute, realized by sampling in an smart way over the input space.
